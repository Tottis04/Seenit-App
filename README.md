\# Seenit (Work in Progress)

Seenit is a mobile app built with React Native, designed to let users capture and share real moments in a simple and emotional way.

##  Concept

Users can take photos and choose either:
- **Send**: Share the photo with someone.
- **Keep**: Save it privately in a "My Capsules" tab.

Photos saved privately are blurred and locked. Users must spend 1 point to unlock them. Points are earned by maintaining activity streaks.

The app is meant to be:
- **Minimal**
- **Emotional**
- **Future-facing**

##  Features (Planned)

- [x] Take a photo with camera
- [x] Option to send or keep
- [ ] Blurred & locked capsules system
- [ ] Streak-based point system
- [ ] Full screen capsule tab UI
- [ ] Smooth transitions and clean design

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo
- **Language**: JavaScript / TypeScript
- **State**: Context API
- **Navigation**: React Navigation

##  Current Status

The app is still under development. Some screens and logic are working (e.g. camera capture and tab navigation), while the streak system and full UI are still in progress.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

Inspired by apps like BeReal and the emotional weight of personal memory, Seenit offers a new take on sharing and storing moments â€” with a twist.
